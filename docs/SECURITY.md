# Security Documentation

## Overview

SynchroHR implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect sensitive HR data and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT-Based Authentication
- JSON Web Tokens with RS256 signing algorithm
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
- SMS-based verification (future enhancement)
- Hardware security keys support (future enhancement)

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  EMPLOYEE = 'employee',
  MANAGER = 'manager',
  HR = 'hr',
  INTERN = 'intern',
  SENIOR_MANAGER = 'senior_manager',
  ADMIN = 'admin'
}
```

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Database-level encryption for PII data
- File storage encryption for resumes and documents

#### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled
- Certificate pinning for mobile clients

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Job postings, company information
- **Internal**: Employee directory, organizational data
- **Confidential**: Salaries, performance reviews, medical data
- **Restricted**: PII, financial data, legal documents

### Security Headers

The application implements comprehensive security headers:

```typescript
// Content Security Policy
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co; frame-ancestors 'none';"

// HTTP Strict Transport Security
"Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"

// X-Frame-Options
"X-Frame-Options": "DENY"

// X-Content-Type-Options
"X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff"

// Referrer Policy
"Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"

// Permissions Policy
"Permissions-Policy": "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()"
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Client-Side Validation
```typescript
import Joi from 'joi';

const userSchema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  password: Joi.string().min(8).pattern(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/).required(),
  firstName: Joi.string().min(2).max(50).required(),
  lastName: Joi.string().min(2).max(50).required()
});
```

#### Server-Side Validation
- All inputs validated using Joi schemas
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- File upload validation and virus scanning

### Rate Limiting

#### API Rate Limits
```typescript
const rateLimitConfig = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
}
```

#### User-Based Limits
- Employee: 1000 requests/hour
- Manager: 2000 requests/hour
- HR: 5000 requests/hour
- Admin: 10000 requests/hour

### Audit Logging

#### Security Events Logged
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Data access/modification
- Configuration changes
- Security policy violations

#### Log Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T10:00:00Z",
  "event": "AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "metadata": {
    "method": "POST",
    "endpoint": "/auth/login",
    "duration": 150
  }
}
```

### GDPR Compliance

#### Data Subject Rights
- **Right to Access**: Users can export their data
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can update their information
- **Right to Erasure**: Account deletion with data removal
- **Right to Data Portability**: Data export in machine-readable format
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: Data processing controls

#### Data Retention
- Active user data: Retained indefinitely
- Inactive accounts: 7 years after deactivation
- Audit logs: 7 years minimum
- Backup data: 30 days rolling retention

### Vulnerability Management

#### Security Scanning
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: SonarQube/CodeQL
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy (future enhancement)

#### Patch Management
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security patches deployed within 30 days of release

### Incident Response

#### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise
- **High**: Unauthorized access, service disruption
- **Medium**: Policy violation, suspicious activity
- **Low**: Failed login attempts, minor issues

#### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Incident triage and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore services and data
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements
